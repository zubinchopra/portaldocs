# NuGet Packages

The Azure Portal SDK ships framework assemblies, tools, test framework and extension [PDE](portalfx-extensions-glossary-onboarding.md) files as NuGet packages. It also provides the capability to ship extensions as NuGet packages. This allows extensions to invoke blades and parts from other extensions at runtime. For more information about sharing  extensions as NuGet packages, see [portalfx-pde-publish.md](portalfx-pde-publish.md).

## Configure NuGet package sources for development

In order to download the NuGet packages as part of an extension, developers can choose between CoreXT compatible package sources or consume the packages installed locally by the MSI. Choose a configuration that applies to your extension development context.

### Microsoft Internal NuGet Feed

Portal SDK NuGet packages are published to the Microsoft internal NuGet feed located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/nugetfeed](https://aka.ms/portalfx/nugetfeed).  Depending on your internal build system, the configuration of how to consume this feed will vary.  For the latest guidance on consuming the feed within your build system, consult your build system's documentation. For those using 1ES systems, see the NuGet in 1ES guide located at [https://www.1eswiki.com/wiki/NuGet_in_1ES](https://www.1eswiki.com/wiki/NuGet_in_1ES).

### Getting the NuGet packages externally

PortalSDK NuGet packages are only published to Microsoft internal NuGet feeds.  If you do not have access to feeds like the one in the previous section, use the Portal MSI to deliver NuGet packages to your development machines.  This is the recommended path for [third party extension developers](portalfx-extensions-glossary-onboarding.md).

Installing the Portal SDK MSI will unpack the NuGet packages to a default location of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\PortalSDK\packages` and will setup a NuGet package source named PortalSDK that points to that location.  Any subsequent actions performed in **Visual Studio** or the **NuGet** command line will also search the new local PortalSDK feed in program files for Portal-related NuGet packages.

## Updating your extension to a newer version of the SDK

### Update your NuGet Packages

<!-- Determine where the NuGet Package Manager is located in VS 2015 and 2017 --> 
* In Visual Studio
1. Install the latest version of the Portal SDK MSI, as specified in [downloads.md](downloads.md).
1. In Visual Studio select `Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console…`.
1. Select all `Microsoft.Portal.*` NuGet package.
1. Click the `Update` button.
1. Build and fix any breaking changes.

* In CoreXT
1. Find the latest SDK version number from the SDK downloads.
1. Run `init.cmd`.

    **NOTE**: Your $(Pkg*) references in your `csproj` file  should automatically update to point at the newest restored NuGet.
1. Copy over /Content files to get latest *.d.ts and *.pde files.

    **NOTE**:  CoreXT does not copy content files. Typically, internal teams use either a `<Target />` or a `NuGetContentRestore` task to rehydrate the Content files from their CxCache.
1. Build and fix any breaking changes.

### [Optional] Update the pdl XSD

TODO: would need a separate path of shipping the XSD to provide another path here where they don't need to update the SDK.

**NOTE**:  `<repoRootPath>`, without the angle brackets, is the path to the extension repository on the development computer.

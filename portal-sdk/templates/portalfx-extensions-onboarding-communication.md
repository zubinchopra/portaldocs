## Communication
   
Plan ahead for all the outbound communication, blogging, and marketing work that publicizes new services during the time that they are being deployed to customers.  This coordination is important, particularly when software release commitments are aligned with the Azure events and conferences. This coordination may be optional for preview releases, but the localized azure.com content and service updates plan are required for stakeholder signoff, if the extension will be deployed to GA.

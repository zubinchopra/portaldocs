# Getting started with Azure CDN

The Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is designed to send audio, video, images, and other files faster and more reliably to customers by using servers that are closest to the users. These built-in CDN capabilities in the SDK dramatically increase speed and availability, and result in significant improvements in the user experience.

Developers may use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static images, scripts, and stylesheets. The Azure Portal SDK does not require the use of a CDN, or the use of a specific  CDN.

The benefits of using the CDN to cache web site assets include the following.

* Better performance and user experience for end users

    This is especially true for applications that require multiple round-trips to load content.

* Large scaling to better handle single-event high loads
    
    For example, the start of a product launch event will cause a sharp increase in user access that is not predictable on an annual basis

* Less traffic is sent to the origin

    User requests are distributed, which allows edge servers to serve content

The `CdnIntegrationBlade` allows customers to create and manage CDN endpoints for their existing Azure resources, as in the following example.

 **NOTE**: The CdnIntegrationBlade only works in public Azure and is NOT available in national clouds like MoonCake or BlackForest. 
 
If you want to develop extensions that use the Content Delivery Network, create a code review and add "cdneng" as reviewers. Or, contact the Ibiza team for questions, concerns, or bug reports by using the StackOverflow tag .

### The CdnIntegration blade

Through simple integration, your customers can enable CDN on their Azure resources within your extension without navigating to the CDN extension. The CdnIntegrationBlade uses the following inputs.

**resourceId**: The id of your ARM resource. For example, if the Azure CDN blade is called from a Storage resource menu, the resourceId for a storage account would resemble the following string. 
`/subscriptions/93456ca3-e4aa-4986-ab1c-98afe7a12345/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.ClassicStorage/storageAccounts/storagetest1`. 

**location**: The geographic location of your resource, like "West US", or "East Asia". More information about extension versioning is specified in [top-extensions-hosting-service.md#upload-safe-deployment-config](top-extensions-hosting-service.md#upload-safe-deployment-config).

**originHostname**: The hostname of the service which is used as an origin for the created CDN endpoints. The hostname cannot contain slashes or protocols; instead it can contain only the domain name, like "storagetest1.blob.core.windows.net" or "webapptest2.azurewebsites.net".

Use the following steps to embed the CDN integration blade into your extension.

1. [Import the CDN Extension NuGet Package](#importing-cdn-extension-nuget-package)
1. [Reference the CDN PDE](#reference-the-cdn-pde)
1. [Reference the CDN Integration Blade](#reference-the-cdn-integration-blade)
1. [Telemetry and Monitoring](#telemetry-and-monitoring)

## Import the CDN extension nuget package

To use the CDN integration blade, the extension should reference the `Microsoft.Portal.Extensions.Cdn` NuGet package.
For CoreXT-based environments, the project should have a reference to the package in the  `corext.config`  file or the  `packages.config` file as in the following example. Otherwise,  reference the package as appropriate in your development environment.

```xml
<package id="Microsoft.Portal.Extensions.Cdn" version="1.0.13.177" />
```

*NOTE**: Remember to use the latest version that is located at [https://msazure.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/One/_apps/hub/ms.feed.feed-hub?feedName=Official&protocolType=NuGet&packageName=microsoft.portal.extensions.cdn](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/One/_apps/hub/ms.feed.feed-hub?feedName=Official&protocolType=NuGet&packageName=microsoft.portal.extensions.cdn).

## Reference the CDN PDE

In the extension *.csproj file, add a reference to the `Microsoft_Azure_Cdn.pde` similar to the following code.
```xml
<ExtensionReference Include="$(PkgMicrosoft_Portal_Extensions_Cdn)\content\Client\_extensions\Cdn\Microsoft_Azure_Cdn.pde" />
```

## Reference the CDN Integration Blade

For the CdnIntegrationBlade to show up in your extension, you may reference it in one of two ways.

 1. It can be an item in the Resource menu, as in the following code. 
	```ts
	{
		id: "cdnIntegration",
		displayText: "Azure CDN",
		enabled: ko.observable(true),
		visible: ko.observable(true), //Shouldn't be visible in national clouds
		keywords: [
			"cdn",
			"endpoint",
			"profile",
			"domain"
		],
		icon: MsPortalFx.Base.Images.Polychromatic.Cdn(),
		supplyBladeReference: () => {
			return new CdnBladeReferences.CdnIntegrationBladeReference(
				{
					resourceId: <your resource Id>,
					location: <your resource location>,
					originHostname: <your resource hostname>
				});
		}
	}
	```

1. It can be opened as a DynamicBladeSelection, which does not require importing the CDN NuGget package.  An example is in the following code.
	```ts
	this._container.selectable.selectedValue(<MsPortalFx.ViewModels.DynamicBladeSelection>{
			extension: "Microsoft_Azure_Cdn",
			detailBlade: "CdnIntegrationBlade",
			detailBladeInputs: {
				resourceId: this.resourceUri(),
				location: this._siteView.item().Location(),
				originHostname: this._siteView.item().DefaultHostName()
			}
		});            
	```

## Telemetry and monitoring

Ibiza tracks the usage and actions on the CDN integration blade by using the  following metrics.

* Number of CDN Endpoints created from partner extensions as opposed to CDN extensions.
* Number of customers clicking Azure CDN from partner extensions.
* Number of customers managing CDN from partner extensions.
* Percentage of customers initiating a CDN create operation after landing into the Azure CDN blade. 
* Percentage of success and failure of create operations from the Azure CDN blade.

No extra telemetry is required from the extension.

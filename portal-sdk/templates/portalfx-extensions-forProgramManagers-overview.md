## Conceptual Overview

The items that are being developed are named extensions, or blades.  Some examples of blades are in the following image.

Onboarding a service, or developing a portal extension, has three phases: private preview, public preview, and GA.  The development of a portal can stop at any one of those steps, depending on content.  A portal can also proceed to the next step when it meets the exit criteria for the current step. These phases are discussed in the sections named Private Preview, Public Preview, and GA.

Quality metrics and exit criteria are tracked for every extension, in order to meet customer expectations and increase customer satisfaction. For more information about quality metrics, see the One Compliance System Web site that is located at [https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/1CS/SitePages/Home.aspx](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/1CS/SitePages/Home.aspx). There may or may not be tools to install from this site that are part of the Quality Essentials process.

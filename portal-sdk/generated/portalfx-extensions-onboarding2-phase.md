## Development

Developing a Portal extension has three phases: private preview, public preview, and Global Availability (GA). Azure Portal onboarding is creating a UI for a service in Azure Portal, and is a subset of Azure onboarding.

Most services that onboard to Azure can leverage the following components of the Azure ecosystem:
1. Management APIs that are exposed via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) or Microsoft Graph
1. Management UI in the Azure Portal and/or other tools/websites, like Visual Studio
1. Marketing content on the Azure Web site or other websites

The Azure onboarding process is streamlined to optimize the delivery of high-quality experiences based on hundreds of hours of usability testing that meet Microsoft Common Engineering Criteria (CEC) and compliance requirements. This will better optimize developer resources and reduce re-working due to anti-patterns and inconsistencies that block usability, performance, and other factors. Therefore, we strongly recommend starting the onboarding process previous to designing UI or management APIs.

Perform the following tasks to develop an Azure extension.

1. [Learn about the hosting service](portalfx-extensions-onboarding2-hosting.md)

1. [Develop the extension](portalfx-extensions-onboarding2-develop.md)

1. [Register the extension](portalfx-extensions-onboarding2-registration.md)

## Best Practices
   
Portal development patterns or architectures that are recommended based on customer feedback and usability studies are located in the topic for the blade that is being developed. For more information, see [portalfx-blades-best-practices.md](portalfx-blades-best-practices.md).

### SSL Certs
   
   <!-- TODO:  FAQ Format is ###Link, ***title***, Description, Solution, 3 Asterisks -->
   
***How do I use SSL certs?***
 
 SSL Certs are relevant only for teams that host their own extensions.  Azure Portal ONLY supports loading extensions from HTTPS URLs. Use a wildcard SSL cert for each environment to simplify maintenance, for example,   ``` *.<extensionName>.onecloud-ext.azure-test.net  ``` or  ``` *.<extensionName>.ext.azure.com) ``` .    To simplify overall management when your team is building separate, independent extensions, you can also use  ``` <extensionName>.<team>.ext.azure.com ``` and create a wildcard SSL cert for  ``` *.<team>.ext.azure.com ```. Internal teams can create SSL certs for the DogFood environment using the SSL Administration Web page that is located at [http://ssladmin](http://ssladmin). 
 
  Production certs must follow your organization’s PROD cert process. 

 **NOTE** Do not use the SSL Admin site for production certs.

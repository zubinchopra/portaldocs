### SSL certificates

   <!-- TODO:  FAQ Format is ###Link, ***title***, Description, Solution, 3 Asterisks -->
   
***How do I use SSL certs?***
 
SSL Certs are relevant only for teams that host their own extensions.  Azure Portal ONLY supports loading extensions from HTTPS URLs. Use a wildcard SSL cert for each environment to simplify maintenance, for example,   ``` *.<extensionName>.onecloud-ext.azure-test.net  ``` or  ``` *.<extensionName>.ext.azure.com) ``` .    To simplify overall management when your team is building separate, independent extensions, you can also use  ``` <extensionName>.<team>.ext.azure.com ``` and create a wildcard SSL cert for  ``` *.<team>.ext.azure.com ```. Internal teams can create SSL certs for the DogFood environment using the SSL Administration Web page that is located at [http://ssladmin](http://ssladmin). 
 
 Production certs must follow your organization’s PROD cert process. 

 **NOTE** Do not use the SSL Admin site for production certs.

### Checking the version of a loaded extension

***I have set ApplicationContext.Version for my extension, how do I check what version of my extension is currently loaded in shell ?***

1.  Navigate to the Portal where your extension is hosted or side loaded.
1. Press F12 in the browser and select the console tab.
1. Set the current frame dropdown to that of your extension.
1. In the console type `fx.environment.version` and click enter to see the version of the extension on the client, as in the following image.

    ![alt-text](../media/portalfx-debugging/select-extension-iframe.png "Select extension iframe")

1. In addition, any requests that are made to the extension, including **Ajax** calls, should also return the version on the server in the response, as in the following image.

    ![alt-text](../media/portalfx-debugging/response-headers-show-version.png "Response Headers from extension show version")

  **NOTE**: There  can be a difference in the `fx.environment.version` on the client and the version in the `x-ms-version` returned from the server.  This can occur when the user starts a session and the extension is updated/deployed while the session is still active.

## Forms

FAQ's for forms.

<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
## Frequently asked questions

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-should-i-use-an-action-bar-or-a-commands-toolbar-on-my-form"></a>
### Should I use an action bar or a commands toolbar on my form?

It depends on the scenario that drives the UX. If the form will capture some data from the user and expect the blade to be closed after submitting the changes, then use an action bar, as specified in [portalfx-ux-create-forms.md#action-bar-+-blue-buttons](portalfx-ux-create-forms.md#action-bar-+-blue-buttons).  However, if the form will edit or update some data, and expect the user to make multiple changes before the blade is closed, then use commands, as specified in [portalfx-commands.md](portalfx-commands.md). 

* Action Bar

  The action bar will have one button whose label is something like "OK", "Create", or "Submit". The blade should automatically close immediately after the action bar button is clicked. Users can abandon the form by clicking the Close button that is located at the top right of the application bar. Developers can use a `ParameterProvider` to simplify the code, because it provisions the `editScope` and implicitly closes the blade based on clicking on the action bar. 

  Alternatively, the action bar can contain two buttons, like "OK" and "Cancel", but that requires further configuration. The two-button method is not recommended because the "Cancel" button is made redundant by the Close button.

* Commands
  
  Typically, the two commands at the top of the blade are the "Save" command and the "Discard" command. The user can make edits and click "Save" to commit the changes. The blade should show the appropriate UX for saving the data, and will stay on the screen after the data has been saved. The user can make further changes and click "Save" again. The user can also discard their changes by clicking "Discard". Once the user is satisfied with the changes, they can close the blade manually.
  
* * * 

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-discard-change-pop-up-always-displayed"></a>
### Discard change pop-up always displayed

***Q: My users see the 'discard change?' pop-up, even when they've made no changes on my Form Blade. What's wrong?*** 

The EditScope `root` property returns an object or array that includes uses of Knockout observables (`KnockoutObservable<T>` and `KnockoutObservableArray<T>`). Any observable located within the EditScope is designed to be modified/updated only by the user, via Form fields that are bound to EditScope observables. Importantly, these EditScope observables were not designed to be modified directly from extension TypeScript code. If extension code modifies an observable during the Form/Blade initialization process, the EditScope will record this as a user edit, and this accidental edit will trigger the `discard changes` pop-up when the user tries to close the associated Blade.  

SOLUTION:
Rather than initializing the EditScope by programmatically modifying/updating EditScope observables, use these alternative techniques:
* If the extension uses a ParameterProvider component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the '`mapIncomingData[Async]`' callback supplied to ParameterProvider.
* If the extension uses an EditScopeCache component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the '`supplyNewData`' and '`supplyExistingData`' callbacks supplied to EditScopeCache.
* If neither of the above techniques suits the scenario, the '`editScope.resetValue()`' method can be used to set a new/initial value for an EditScope observable in a way that *is not recorded as a user edit* (although this only works for observables storing primitive-typed values).  
  
* * *

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-editscope-location"></a>
### EditScope Location

***Q: I need to integrate my Form with an EditScope. Where do I get the EditScope?*** 

SOLUTION: This varies according to the UX design. Developers can choose between using a `ParameterProvider` component or `EditScopeCache` component as follows:

* Use `ParameterProvider` for the following scenario:
    * **Pop-up/dialog-like form** - The blade uses an ActionBar with an 'Ok'-like button that commits user edits. Typically, when the user commits the edits, the blade is implicitly closed, like a conventional UI pop-up/dialog. The blade uses `parameterProvider.editScope` to access the loaded/initialized EditScope.

* Use `EditScopeCache` for the following scenarios:
    * **Save/Revert blade** - There are 'Save' and 'Revert changes' commands in the CommandBar of the blade. Typically, these commands keep the blade open so the user can perform successive edit and save cycles without closing and reopening the form. The blade uses an `EditScopeView`, as specified in  `editScopeCache.createView(...)`, to load/acquire the EditScope.  

    * **Document editing** - The blade uses an `EditScopeView`, as specified in  `editScopeCache.createView(...)`, to load/acquire the EditScope.   The user can make edits to a single EditScope/Form model across multiple parent-child blades. The parent blade sends its `inputs.editScopeId` input to any child blade that edits the same model as the parent Blade. The child blade uses this `inputs.editScopeId` in its call to `editScopeView.fetchForExistingData(editScopeId)` to fetch the EditScope of the parent Blade. Scenarios like these resemble document editing.

### Keeping EditScope from tracking changes

this.parameterProvider = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.ParameterProvider<string[], KnockoutObservableArray<StringWrapperType>>(container, {
    editScopeMetadataType: wrapperTypeMetadataName,
    mapIncomingDataForEditScope: (incoming) => {
        // Editable grid only accepts an array of editable entities (that is, objects and not strings).
        const wrappedStrings = incoming.map((str) => {
            return {
                value: ko.observable(str)
            };
        });
        return ko.observableArray(wrappedStrings);  // Editable grid can only bind to an observable array.
    },
    mapOutgoingDataForCollector: (outgoing) => {
        const editScope = this.parameterProvider.editScope();

        // Use EditScope's 'getEntityArrayWithEdits' to return an array with all created/updated/deleted items.
        const entityArrayWithEdits = editScope.getEntityArrayWithEdits<StringWrapperType>(outgoing);

        // Unwrap each string to produce the expected string array.
        return entityArrayWithEdits.arrayWithEdits.map((wrapper) => {
            return wrapper.value();
        });
    }
});

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-q-what-should-be-returned-from-saveeditscopechanges-i-don-t-understand-the-different-values-of-the-accepteditscopechangesaction-enum"></a>
### Q: What should be returned from &#39;saveEditScopeChanges&#39;? I don&#39;t understand the different values of the <code>AcceptEditScopeChangesAction</code> enum.

<!-- TODO:  Move this to the EditScope document -->

SOLUTION: 
When creating an EditScopeCache, the `saveEditScopeChanges` callback supplied by the extension is called to push EditScope edits to a server/backend. This callback returns a `Promise` that should be resolved when the 'save' AJAX call completes, which occurs after the server/backend accepts the user's edits. 

When the extension resolves this `Promise`, it can supply a value that instructs the EditScope to  reset itself to a clean/unedited state. If no such value is returned during Promise resolution, then the EditScope is reset by default.  This means taking the user's client-side edits and considering these values to be the new, clean/unedited EditScope state. This works for many scenarios.  

There are scenarios where the default `saveEditScopeChanges` behavior does not work, like: the following. 
* During 'save', the server/backend produces new data values that need to be merged into the EditScope.
* For "create new record" scenarios, after 'save', the extension should clear the form, so that the user can enter a new record.

For these cases, the extension will resolve the `saveEditScopeChanges` Promise with a value from the `AcceptEditScopeChangesAction` enum. These values allow the extension to specify conditions like the following.
* The EditScopeCache is to implicitly reload the EditScope data as part of completing the 'save' operation.
* The EditScope's data is to be reverted/cleared as part of completing the 'save' operation (the "create new record" UX scenario).

For more information about each enum value, see the jsdoc comments around `MsPortalFx.Data.AcceptEditScopeChangesAction` or in `MsPortalFxDocs.js` in Visual Studio or any code editor.

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-q-what-should-be-returned-from-saveeditscopechanges-i-don-t-understand-the-different-values-of-the-accepteditscopechangesaction-enum-caveat-anti-pattern"></a>
#### Caveat / anti-pattern

There is an important anti-pattern to avoid here re: '`saveEditScopeChanges`'. If the AJAX call that saves the user's edits fails, the extension should merely **reject** the '`saveEditScopeChanges`' Promise (which is natural to do with Q Promise-chaining/piping). The extension *should not* resolve their Promise with '`AcceptEditScopeChangesAction.DiscardClientChanges`', since this will lose the user's Form edits (a data-loss bug).

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-common-error-entity-typed-object-array-is-not-known-to-this-edit-scope"></a>
### Common error: &quot;Entity-typed object/array is not known to this edit scope...&quot;

SOLUTION: 
EditScope data follows a particular data model. In short, the EditScope is a hierarchy of 'entity' objects. By default, when the EditScope's '`root`' is an object, this object is considered an 'entity'. The EditScope becomes a hierarchy of 'entities' when:
* the EditScope includes an array of 'entity' objects
* some EditScope object includes a property that is 'entity'-typed  

An object is treated by EditScope as an 'entity' when type metadata associated with the object is marked as an 'entity' type (see [here](#entity-type) and the EditScope video located at [here](portalfx-legacy-editscopes.md) for more details).

Every 'entity' object is tracked by the EditScope as being created/updated/deleted. Extension developers define 'entities' at a granularity that suit their scenario, making it easy to determine what in their larger EditScope/Form data model has been user-edited.  

Now, regarding the error above, once the EditScope is initialized/loaded, 'entities' can be introduced and removed from the EditScope only via EditScope APIs. It is an unfortunate design limitation of EditScope that extensions cannot simply make an observable change to add a new 'entity' object or remove an existing 'entity' from the EditScope. If an extension tries to do an observable add (make an observable change that introduces an 'entity' object into the EditScope), they'll encounter the error discussed here.  

To correctly (according to the EditScope design) add or remove an 'entity' object into/out of an EditScope, here are APIs that are useful:
* ['`applyArrayAsEdits`'](#apply-array-as-edits) - This API accepts a new array of 'entity' objects. The EditScope proceeds to diff this new array against the existing EditScope array items, determine which 'entity' objects are created/updated/deleted, and then records the corresponding user edits.
* '`getCreated/addCreated`' - These APIs allow for the addition of new, 'created' entity objects. The '`getCreated`' method returns a distinct, out-of-band array that collects all 'created' entities corresponding to a given 'entity' array. The '`addCreated`' method is merely a helper method that places a new 'entity' object in this '`getCreated`' array.
* '`markForDelete`' - 'Deleting' an 'entity' from the EditScope is treated as a non-destructive operation. This is so that - if the extension chooses - they can render 'deleted' (but unsaved) edits with strike-through styling (or equivalent). Calling this '`markForDelete`' method merely puts the associated 'entity' in a 'deleted' state.  

* * *

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-common-error-entity-typed-object-array-is-not-known-to-this-edit-scope-common-error-scenario"></a>
#### Common error scenario

SOLUTION: 
Often, extensions encounter this "Entity-typed object/array is not known to this edit scope..." error as a side-effect of modeling their data as 'entities' binding with [editable grid](#editable-grid) in some ParameterProvider Blade.  Then, commonly, the error is encountered when applying the array edits in a corresponding ParameterCollector Blade.  Here are two schemes that can be useful to avoid this error:
* Use the [`applyArrayAsEdits'](#apply-array-as-edits) EditScope method mentioned above to commit array edits to an EditScope.
* Define type metadata for this array *twice* - once only for editing the data in an editable grid (array items typed as 'entities'), and separately for committing to an EditScope in the ParameterCollector Blade (array items typed as not 'entities').  
  
* * *

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-editable-object-not-present"></a>
### Editable object not present

***"Encountered a property 'foo' on an editable object that is not present on the original object..."***

SOLUTION: 
As discussed in [portalfx-extensions-faq-forms.md#key-value-pairs](portalfx-extensions-faq-forms.md#key-value-pairs), the extension should mutate the EditScope/Form model by making observable changes and by calling EditScope APIs. For any object residing in the `EditScope`, merely adding and removing keys cannot be detected by `EditScope` or by the FX at large and, consequently, edits cannot be tracked. When an extension attempts to add or remove keys from an `EditScope` object, this puts the `EditScope` edit-tracking in an inconsistent state. When the `EditScope` detects such an inconsistency, it issues the `Encountered a property...` error to encourage the extension developer to use only observable changes and `EditScope` APIs to mutate/change the EditScope/Form model.

### Content Unbundler throws aggregate exception

***Content Unbundler throws an Aggregate Exception during build.***

This usually happens when the build output generated by content unbundler is different from expected format.  The solution is as follows.

1. Verify build output directory is called **bin**
1. Verify you can point IIS to **bin** directory and load extension

### Finding old UX After Deployment

***Some customers of my extension are finding the old UX even after deploying the latest package. Is there a bug in hosting service ?***

No this is not a bug. All clients will not get the new version as soon as it gets deployed. The new version is only served when the customer refreshes the Portal. We have seen customers that keep the Portal open for long periods of time. In such scenarios, when customer loads the extension they are going to get the old version that has been cached.
We have seen scenarios where customers did not refresh the Portal for 2 weeks.

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-how-extensions-are-served"></a>
### How extensions are served

***How does hosting service serve my extension?***

The runtime component of the hosting service is hosted inside an Azure Cloud Service. When an extension onboards, a publicly accessible endpoint is provided by the extension developer which will contain the contents that the hosting service should serve. For the hosting service to pick them up, it will look for a file called `config.json` that has a specific schema described below. 

The hosting service will upload the config file, look into it to figure out which zip files it needs to download. There can be multiple versions of the extension referenced in `config.json`. The hosting service will upload them and unpack them on the local disk. After it has successfully uploaded and expanded all versions of the extension referenced in `config.json`, it will write `config.json` to disk.

For performance reasons, once a version is uploaded, it will not be uploaded again. 

* * * 

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-output-zip-file-incorrectly-named"></a>
### Output zip file incorrectly named

***When I build my project, the output zip is called HostingSvc.zip instead of \<some version>.zip.***

The primary cause of this issue is that your `web.config` appSetting for **IsDevelopmentMode** is `true`.  It needs to be set to `false`.  Most do this using a `web.Release.config` transform. For example,

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

    <!-- For more information on using web.config transformation visit http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125889 -->

    <configuration xmlns:xdt="http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform">
      <appSettings>
        <!-- dont forget to ensure the Key is correct for your specific extension -->
        <add key="Microsoft.Portal.Extensions.Monitoring.ApplicationConfiguration.IsDevelopmentMode" value="false" xdt:Transform="SetAttributes" xdt:Locator="Match(key)"/>
      </appSettings>
    </configuration>

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-speed-up-test-cycles"></a>
### Speed up test cycles

***My local build is slow. How can I speed up the dev/test cycles ?***

The default F5 experience for extension development remains unchanged however with the addition of the **ContentUnbundler** target some teams prefer to optimize to only run it on official builds or when they set a flag to force it to run.  The following example demonstrates how the Azure Scheduler extension is doing this within **CoreXT**.

```xml
    <PropertyGroup>
        <ForceUnbundler>false</ForceUnbundler>
    </PropertyGroup>
    <Import Project="$(PkgMicrosoft_Portal_Tools_ContentUnbundler)\build\Microsoft.Portal.Tools.ContentUnbundler.targets" 
            Condition="'$(IsOfficialBuild)' == 'true' Or '$(ForceUnbundler)' == 'true'" />
```

* * * 

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-storage-account-registration"></a>
### Storage account registration

***Do I need to register a new storage account everytime I need to upload zip file ?***

No. Registering a storage account with the hosting service is one-time process, as specified in . This allows the hosting service to find the latest version of your extension.

* * * 

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-zip-file-replaced-in-storage-account"></a>
### Zip file replaced in storage account

***What happens if instead of publishing new version to my storage account I replace the zip file ?***

Hosting service will only serve the new versions of zip file. If you replace version `1.0.0.0.zip` with a new version of `1.0.0.0.zip`, then hosting service will not detect.
It is required that you publish new zip file with a different version number, for example `2.0.0.0.zip`, and update `config.json` to reflect that hosting service should service new version of extension.

Sample config.json for version 2.0.0.0

```json
    {
        "$version": "3",
        "stage1": "2.0.0.0",
        "stage2": "2.0.0.0",
        "stage3": "2.0.0.0",
        "stage4": "2.0.0.0",
        "stage5": "2.0.0.0",
    }
```
**NOTE**: This samples depicts that all stages are serving version 2.0.0.0.

#### Sideloading friendly names

***Sideloading friendly names is not working in the Dogfood environment***

In order for Portal to load a test version of an extension, i.e., load without using the PROD configuration, developers can append the feature flag `feature.canmodifystamps`. The following example uses the sideload url to load the "test" version of extension.

`https://portal.azure.com?feature.canmodifystamps=true&<extensionName>=test`

The parameter `feature.canmodifystamps=true` is required for side-loading, and 
 **extensionName**, without the angle brackets, is replaced with the unique name of extension as defined in the `extension.pdl` file.

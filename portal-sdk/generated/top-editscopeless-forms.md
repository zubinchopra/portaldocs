## EditScopeless Forms

Edit scopes provide a standard way of managing edits over a collection of input fields, blades, and extensions. They provide common functions that would otherwise be difficult to orchestrate, like tracking changes in field values across a form, or simplifying the merge of form changes from the server into the current edit. In contrast, forms that do not use `editScopes` are compatible with new controls and consequently, EditScopes are becoming obsolete. It is recommended that extensions be developed without `editScopes`.

Form controls are located in the `Fx/Controls` namespace. They support creating forms without initializing an  `editscope`.  The form controls are specified in [top-extensions-controls.md](top-extensions-controls.md). 

Without an editscope, the controls become stateless. This means that there is no initial value for the control, and the developer can update the state of the control by setting the `dirty` value when the control's data changes.

In the following example, the value of a control is initialized by setting it.

```
textboxViewModel.value("Some Initial Value");
```  

In the following example, the state of the control is updated.

    ```ts
    textboxViewModel.dirty(true);
    ```  
 
The following controls also have their own documentation.

| Control                 | Document                                                                             |

## Changing forms to work without EditScopes

Several new Azure controls are compatible with EditScope-backed controls. 

This process specifies how to add the editscopeless **Name**  TextBox control from the `Fx/Controls/TextBox` module to an EditScope-based control. 

**NOTE**: In this discussion, `<dir>` is the `SamplesExtension\Extension\` directory, and  `<dirParent>`  is the `SamplesExtension\` directory, based on where the samples were installed when the developer set up the SDK. 

This procedure uses the EngineV3 sample that is located at  `<dir>\Client\V1\Create\EngineV3\ViewModels.ts`.  The  control is also included in the working sample located at  [https://df.onecloud.azure-test.net/#blade/SamplesExtension/SampleMenuBlade/createengine](https://df.onecloud.azure-test.net/#blade/SamplesExtension/SampleMenuBlade/createengine).

For more information about the create engine, see [portalfx-create-engine-sample.md](portalfx-create-engine-sample.md).

1. Import modules

    All new controls are located in `Fx/Controls` namespace. Use the following snippet to import the `TextBox` module into your code.

    ```ts 
    import * as TextBox from "Fx/Controls/TextBox";
    import * as Validations from "Fx/Controls/Validations"
    ```

1. Modify textBox type

    Change the control type for the name of the engine so that it is using the editscopeless `TextBox`.

    ```ts
    /**
    * The view model for the form element for the engine name.
    **/
    public engineName: TextBox.Contract;
    ```

1. Modify Control Initialization

    The `engineName` is initialized inside the `_initializeFormFields` function. Controls inside the `Fx/Controls` namespace use the following factory pattern for initialization.

    ```ts
    this.engineName = TextBox.create(container, {
        label: ClientResources.engineNameColumn,
        subLabel: ClientResources.sampleSubLabel,
        placeHolderText: ClientResources.enterEngineName,
        validations: ko.observableArray([
            new Validations.Required(ClientResources.emptyFirstName),
            new Validations.RegExMatchValidation("^[a-zA-Z]+", ClientResources.startsWithLetterValidationMessage),
            // The 'Reserved Resource Name Validator' makes sure the engine name is not a trademark or reserved word.
            new Validations.ReservedResourceNameValidator(resourceType)
        ])
    });
    ```
   
1. Modify the logic to see initial data in EditScope

    After the data is received, the sample invokes  `_mapIncomingDataForEditScope` to initialize the data in the editScope.  Because the new controls are not tied to editScope, the value of the control is set explicitly.

    Initialize the `dataModel`, and then initialize the value of the TextBox with the following line of code.
    
    ```ts
    this.engineName.value(data.name || "");
    ```

1. Modify the action bar valid computation

   In order to modify the `valid` computation, the existing logic validated the state of the action bar was removed and  replaced by the following logic that computes validation using the `editScope`, along with validation for new TextBox. The new logic is in the following code.

    ```ts
    ko.computed<boolean>(container, () => {
                this.actionBar.valid(this.valid() && this.engineName.valid());
    });
    ```
1. Modify ARM provisioner to use value from new control

    The `_supplyTemplateDeploymentOptions` provides the  ARM provisioner with the template deployment options.
    Because  the form is not backed by editscope, the value of Engine name is sent to the template a little differently, as in the following example.

    ```ts
    var engineName = this.engineName.value(); 
    ```

When this procedure is complete, all the changes that are required for an EditScope-compatible form to work with editscope-less controls have been added.

<!-- The following section is from editscopeless overview.  It is not known how much of the controls is still needed for editscopeless forms. -->

<a name="changing-forms-to-work-without-editscopes-controls-namespace"></a>
### Controls Namespace

The new controls can be used in extensions by importing them, as in the following code.

```ts
import * as Section from "Fx/Controls/Section";
import * as TextBox from "Fx/Controls/TextBox";
``` 

The controls are initialized through a factory method named `create()`. This function returns an interface. The following example invokes the `create()` method to create a TextBox with a specific label, subLabel and a collection of validations.

```ts
import * as TextBox from "Fx/Controls/TextBox";

const firstNameViewModel = TextBox.create(container, {
    label: "First Name",
    subLabel: "Try: John",
    validations: [
        new Validations.Required(ClientResources.emptyFirstName),
        new Validations.RegExMatch("^[a-zA-Z]+", `${ClientResources.startsWithLetterValidationMessage} <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Personal+names+around+the+world" target="_blank">${ClientResources.clickForMoreInfo}</a>`)
    ]
});
```


<a name="changing-forms-to-work-without-editscopes-customizing-alerts"></a>
### Customizing Alerts

The SDK provides two ways to configure the behavior of an alert, which is the pop-up that is displayed when the user tries to close a form that contains unsaved edits. 

1. The alert can suppress the alert by setting the value to `FxViewModels.AlertLevel.None`, as in the following code.

    ```ts
    form.configureAlertOnClose(FxViewModels.AlertLevel.None);
    ```

1. The value of the alert's behavior can be computed and returned to the `Message` function by using an overloaded definition, which is appropriate for more complex scenarios. The behavior of the alert and message are dynamically set, based on the checkbox and textBox, as in the following code.

    ```ts

    this._container.form.configureAlertOnClose(ko.computed(container, () => {
        return {
            showAlert: configureCheckBox.value(),
            message: configureMessageTextBox.value()
        }
    }));
    ```

<a name="changing-forms-to-work-without-editscopes-closing-the-blade"></a>
### Closing the blade

The following code closes the blade.

```ts

const okButtonClick = () => {
    container.closeCurrentBlade({
                            firstName: firstNameViewModel.value(),
                            lastName: lastNameViewModel.value(),
                            spouse: dropDownViewModel.value(),
                            password: passwordViewModel.value(),
                        });
};
```

For more information about opening and closing blades, see [top-blades-opening-and-closing.md](top-blades-opening-and-closing.md).

<a name="replacing-the-action-bar-with-a-button"></a>
## Replacing the action bar with a button

Out-of-the-box CSS classes can be used to dock a button at the bottom of blade and make it look like an Action Bar.

The following sample demonstrates how to replace the action bar by docking a button and an `errorInfo` box at the bottom of the blade by using the `msportalfx-docking-footer` css class. The `msportalfx-padding` class  adds 10 x 10 padding to the docked footer.

```html

<div class='msportalfx-docking-footer msportalfx-padding'>
    <div data-bind='pcControl: errorBox, visible: showErrorBox'></div>
    <div data-bind='pcControl: okButton' class='ext-ok-button'></div><a>Link</a>
</div>

```

Other blade styling css classes, like the ones in the following list, allow the blade to be used as a canvas.

* msportalfx-docking-header
* msportalfx-docking-body
* msportalfx-docking-footer
* msportalfx-padding

 The `msportalfx-docking-*` classes are used when elements will be docked at the header, body or footer of the blade. 

<!-- TODO: Determine whether 10 x 10 is px or some other unit of measurement. -->
The `msportalfx-padding` class adds 10 x 10 padding to the blade.

**NOTE**: Unlike previous version of SDK, No-PDL blades do not add padding or docking content behavior by default. This makes style management easier.

## Frequently asked questions

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-discard-change-pop-up-always-displayed"></a>
### Discard change pop-up always displayed

***Q: My users see the 'discard change?' pop-up, even when they've made no changes on my Form Blade. What's wrong?*** 

The EditScope `root` property returns an object or array that includes uses of Knockout observables (`KnockoutObservable<T>` and `KnockoutObservableArray<T>`). Any observable located within the EditScope is designed to be modified/updated only by the user, via Form fields that are bound to EditScope observables. Importantly, these EditScope observables were not designed to be modified directly from extension TypeScript code. If extension code modifies an observable during the Form/Blade initialization process, the EditScope will record this as a user edit, and this accidental edit will trigger the `discard changes` pop-up when the user tries to close the associated Blade.

SOLUTION:
Rather than initializing the EditScope by programmatically modifying/updating EditScope observables, use these alternative techniques:
* If the extension uses a `ParameterProvider` component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the `mapIncomingData[Async]` callback supplied to ParameterProvider.
* If the extension uses an EditScopeCache component to manage its EditScope, initialize the EditScope data in the `supplyNewData` and `supplyExistingData` callbacks supplied to EditScopeCache.
* If neither of the above techniques suits the scenario, the `editScope.resetValue()` method can be used to set a new/initial value for an EditScope observable in a way that *is not recorded as a user edit* (although this only works for observables storing primitive-typed values).

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-editscope-location"></a>
### EditScope Location

***Q: I need to integrate my Form with an EditScope. Where do I get the EditScope?*** 

**NOTE**:  EditScopes are becoming obsolete.  It is recommended that extensions and forms be developed without edit scopes, as specified in [top-editscopeless-forms.md](top-editscopeless-forms.md).

SOLUTION: Integrate forms with `EditScopes` varies according to the UX design. Developers can choose between using a `ParameterProvider` component or `EditScopeCache` component as follows:

* Use `ParameterProvider` for the following scenario:
    * **Pop-up/dialog-like form** - The blade uses an ActionBar with an 'Ok'-like button that commits user edits. Typically, when the user commits the edits, the blade is implicitly closed, like a conventional UI pop-up/dialog. The blade uses `parameterProvider.editScope` to access the loaded/initialized EditScope.

* Use `EditScopeCache` for the following scenarios:
    * **Save/Revert blade** - There are 'Save' and 'Revert changes' commands in the CommandBar of the blade. Typically, these commands keep the blade open so the user can perform successive edit and save cycles without closing and reopening the form. 

    * **Document editing** - In the document-editing scenario, the user can make edits to a single EditScope/Form model across multiple parent-child blades. The parent blade sends its `inputs.editScopeId` input to any child blade that edits the same model as the parent Blade. The child blade uses this `inputs.editScopeId` in its call to `editScopeView.fetchForExistingData(editScopeId)` to fetch the EditScope of the parent Blade.

### What is an EditScopeAccessor?

***Q: Form fields have two constructor overloads, which should I use? What is an EditScopeAccessor?***

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-type-metadata"></a>
### Type metadata
<!-- TODO:  Move this back to the TypeScript  document -->
***Q: When do I need to worry about type metadata for my EditScope?***

SOLUTION: For many of the most common Form scenarios, there is no need to describe the EditScope/Form model in terms of type metadata. Typically, supplying type metadata is the way to turn on advanced FX behavior, in the same way that .NET developers apply custom attributes to .NET types to tailor .NET FX behavior for each customized types. 

For more information about type metadata, see [portalfx-data-typemetadata.md](portalfx-data-typemetadata.md).

 For EditScope and Forms, extensions supply type metadata for the following scenarios.

 * Editable grid
 
    Specified in [top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays](top-legacy-editscopes.md#editScope-entity-arrays).

 * Opting out of edit tracking 

    Specified in [top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-trackedits-property](top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-trackedits-property).

### Keeping EditScope from tracking changes

***Q: Some of my Form data is not editable. How do I keep EditScope from tracking changes for this data?***

<a name="frequently-asked-questions-key-value-pairs"></a>
### Key-value pairs

***Q: My Form data is just key/value pairs. How do I model a Dictionary/StringMap in EditScope? Why can't I just use a JavaScript object like a property bag?***

DESCRIPTION:  The  Azure Portal FX instantiates an object/array and returns it to the extension to render the UI. Like all data models and `ViewMmodels`, any subsequent mutation of that object/array should be performed by changing/mutating **Knockout** observables. Portal controls and **Knockout** **HTML** template rendering both subscribe to these observables and re-render them only when these observables change value.

This poses a challenge to the common `JavaScript` programming technique of treating a `JavaScript` object as a property bag of key-value pairs. If an extension only adds or removes keys from a datamodel or a `ViewModel` object, the Portal will not be aware of these changes. `EditScope` will not recognize these changes as user edits and therefore such adds/removes will put `EditScope` edit-tracking in an inconsistent state.

SOLUTION:  An extension can model a Dictionary/StringMap/property bag for an `EditScope` by instantiating an  observable array of key/value-pairs, like `KnockoutObservableArray<{ key: string; value: TValue; }>`. 

The users can edit the contents of the  Dictionary/StringMap/property bag by using an editable grid. The editable grid can only be bound to an `EditScope` 'entity' array. This allows the extension to describe the array of key/value-pairs as an 'entity' array.

For more information about how to develop type metadata to use the array with the editable grid, see [top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-getEntityArrayWithEdits-method](top-legacy-editscopes.md#the-getEntityArrayWithEdits-method).

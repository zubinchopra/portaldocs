### General Best Practices

Do not use JavaScript reserved words, as specified in [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/javascript-reserved-words](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/javascript-reserved-words), as names for the icons in your extension.

### Icon incorrectly displayed

***My icon is black!?!***

DESCRIPTION:

The extension  probably circumvents the  icon pre-processing which happens at build time. This pre-processing  prepares the icon to pass the  html sanitizer, which may be why it appears to be black.  The pre-procesor also minifies it, and prepares the icon to react to different themes. 

**NOTE**: The icon may display incorrectly if it is served by using **json**.

SOLUTION: 

Include the icon in your project normally. Build and  look at the generated file.  Find and copy the  fresh sanitized svg markup, and replace it.

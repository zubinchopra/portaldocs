## Overview

Controls are the building blocks of the Azure extension experience. They allow users to view, edit, and analyze data.

The Azure Portal team ships sample code that extension developers can leverage. All developers who install the Portal Framework SDK that is located at [http://aka.ms/portalfx/download](http://aka.ms/portalfx/download) also install the samples on their computers during the installation process. The source for the samples is located in the `Documents\PortalSDK\FrameworkPortal\Extensions\SamplesExtension` folder. The source specifies the namespace in which the control is located. The working copy for sample controls in the Dogfood environment is located at [https://df.onecloud.azure-test.net/#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/controls](https://df.onecloud.azure-test.net/#blade/SamplesExtension/SDKMenuBlade/controls). This document also contains links to working copies of individual controls.

First-party extension developers, i.e. Microsoft employees, have access to the Dogfood environment, therefore they can view the samples that are located at [https://aka.ms/portalfx/viewSamples](https://aka.ms/portalfx/viewSamples).

The Azure components of the experience are documented several ways. 
*  There may be a document that provides guidance about the component, in terms of what it is, what it does, or how it is used. 
* The location of the sample code is included so that the developer can view the source for the component, or modify it as appropriate for the extensions they develop.  
* A working copy of the component can be viewed in the Dogfood environment; in some instances, links are provided to the API reference for the component.
